Instead of calling depth() explicitly for each child node, we return the height of the current node in DFS recursion. When the sub tree of the current node (inclusive) is balanced, the function dfsHeight() returns a non-negative value as the height. Otherwise -1 is returned. According to the leftHeight and rightHeight of the two children, the parent node could check if the sub tree
is balanced, and decides its return value.

In this bottom up approach, each node in the tree only need to be accessed once. Thus the time complexity is O(N), better than the first solution.
