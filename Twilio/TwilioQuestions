implement a function called tripleRotate, which "rotates" all subsequent sets of 3 elements in an array, when the algorithm
for one rotation is as follows:
Given the triplet ['a', 'b', 'c'], the 1st element ('a') is moved to index 1, the 2nd element ('b') is moved to index 2 and the
3rd element ('c') is moved to index 0. Thus, one rotation of the given triplet results in the new array ['c', 'a', 'b'].
